- fix comments with the .media class - how can we get user info?  Should we embed the image associated with comments?  Maybe post on Stackoverflow and mention the embedded comments example.  What about user image?

- not seeing the form to add entries to your list.  This should show by default if: a) there are no entries in your list and you are the list owner.
